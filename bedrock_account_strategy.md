# Decision Guide: Single Account vs. Multi-Account Strategy for Amazon Bedrock

## Overview
When deploying **Amazon Bedrock** in an organization, a key architectural decision is whether to operate it from a **single centralized account**, distribute it across **multiple team or business unit accounts**, or expose it through an **internal API layer**. This decision balances compliance, control, autonomy, scalability, and cost.

---

## Option 1: Single Centralized Account

### Rewards
- **Centralized Control**: Strong governance and consistent configuration.  
- **Simplified Compliance**: Easier auditing and reporting.  
- **Cost Management**: Clear consolidated billing.  
- **Reduced Shadow IT Risk**: Prevents rogue deployments.  
- **Cost**: $$ (low to moderate, predictable baseline)

### Risks
- **Innovation Bottleneck**: Central approvals slow teams.  
- **Scalability Challenges**: Complexity as adoption grows.  
- **Low Team Autonomy**: Less flexibility for experimentation.

### Mitigations
- Automate provisioning and quota management.  
- Establish clear SLAs for central team responsiveness.  
- Provide sandbox environments for experimentation.

---

## Option 2: Multi-Account Distribution

### Rewards
- **Team Autonomy**: Faster innovation and custom setups.  
- **Scalability**: Distributes workloads across accounts.  
- **Experimentation Friendly**: Teams can move quickly.  
- **Cost**: $$$$ (higher overhead from duplicated services)

### Risks
- **Compliance Complexity**: Harder to enforce standards.  
- **Audit Overhead**: Requires multi-account observability.  
- **Cost Fragmentation**: Spend visibility is harder.  
- **Increased Security Risk**: Potential misconfigurations.

### Mitigations
- Use **AWS Organizations & Control Tower** for guardrails.  
- Enforce policies with **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**.  
- Deploy centralized monitoring and billing aggregation.

## Option 3: Centralized Bedrock with Internal API Access

### Rewards
- **Balance of Control & Autonomy**: Centralized compliance with team accessibility.  
- **Reduced Shadow IT**: Consistent entry points.  
- **Familiar Access Model**: Teams consume via internal APIs.  
- **Cost**: $$$ (moderate investment in API development and maintenance)

### Risks
- **Innovation Delay**: If the API lags behind Bedrock feature updates.  
- **Capacity Bottlenecks**: Central team still controls quotas.  
- **Shared Contention**: High demand from one team can impact others.

### Mitigations
- **Self-Service Quotas**: Automate usage scaling with guardrails.  
- **Feature Flags**: Roll out Bedrock features faster via the API.  
- **IaC Templates**: Instant provisioning to reduce bottlenecks.

---

## Recommendation Framework
- **Single Centralized Account ($$)**: Best for compliance-first organizations needing strict governance.  
- **Multi-Account Distribution ($$$$)**: Best for innovation-first organizations with strong governance maturity.  
- **Centralized with Internal API ($$$)**: Best balance for organizations wanting both governance and agility.

---

## Bottom Line
- **Compliance Priority → Single Account ($$)**  
- **Innovation Priority → Multi-Account ($$$$)**  
- **Balanced Approach → Internal API Layer ($$$)**  

Each option has **risks, rewards, and mitigations**, with cost tiers ranging from **$ (lowest)** to **$$$$$ (highest)** depending on complexity and governance maturity.
